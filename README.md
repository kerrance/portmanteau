# Portmanteau Agency
Music Licensing Agency

This basic website is intended to showcase the sync-placements for the Portmanteau Agency.

I built this one-pager myself in 2013 and modernised it in 2018.

### Instructions
* Clone the repo onto your machine and navigate to the root of the project.
* Run `npm install` (or `yarn`) to ensure all Node packages are ready for use.
* Run `bower install` to install frontend packages.
* Use `gulp` to quickly compile source files from `/app` to the `/build` folder.
* Create a local server and view the website in your browser with `gulp watch`.
* To create a production-ready, minified build, run `gulp production`.

All source files can be found in the `/app` folder. These are compiled and
minified into the `/build` folder with `gulp production`.
