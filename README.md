## Development

Clone the repo and run `bundle install` to grab the requirement packages (you may need to sandbox your Ruby via `RVM` or similar). Once installed, use `bundle exec jekyll serve` to kick up a local development environment.

## Updating

Run `bundle update` to ensure Jekyll stack is kept up-to-date.

## Deploying

Push any updates on a feature branch and create a pull request. Anything on `master` will automatically deploy live through Github Pages.
